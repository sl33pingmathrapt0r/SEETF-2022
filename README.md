# SEETF-2022
Write-up to some beginner-friendly challenges: "as" "df", Wayyang.py, babyreeee, BestSoftware from SEETF 2022.  

In these write-ups, I showcase extremely basic methods for recovering flags, using as little libraries as possible for those who are not comfortable with them. The aim is to show that some basic problems can be solved with basic, primitive methods that are easy to understand for all. Enjoy~
